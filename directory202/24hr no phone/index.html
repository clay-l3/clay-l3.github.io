    <p>On Saturday February 1st 2025, I spent a day without my phone. Disconnected from the internet. I started my day
        at 5:30AM because I was going to go snowboarding at Mt. Baker. The forecast predicted that Baker would be
        getting 20 inches of powder! My friends and I hopped in my car and made the drive to Baker. Normally I would be
        navigating with my phone but today I could not so one of my friends just told me where to go.
        We arrived an hour early before the lifts started at 9 so we took our time getting ready, hung out in the car
        and talked. One of my friends had never snowboarded before so this would be his 1st time ever! We got the
        chairlift 2 (total of 8 on the mountain) and headed up the mountain. Chairlift 2 had easy runs so I could give
        my friend some pointers. I tried my best to teach him how to turn from your toes to your heels but there’s only
        so much you can teach them to do in a day. After spending a couple hours trying to teach him the basics, me and
        3 of my other friends split to go ride on the other side of Mt. Baker as we were much more experienced. We rode
        until 3, met back up with everyone else and made our way back to the car. We geared down and headed back down
        the mountain back to Bellingham.
        Overall, my experience without my phone for a day wasn’t too bad as I was able to keep myself distracted most of
        the day snowboarding. Once I got back to Bellingham it was a little boring. I read a bit of a book, ate dinner
        with my friends and went to sleep around midnight. It was a great day!
